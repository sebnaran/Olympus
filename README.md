This software is meant to be practice in development of tools for scientific computation.
The main goal is to develop a package that can find the mimima of a function given a pointwise evaluation using only the standard library.

Here we are using: hashmaps, tuples, inheritance, virtual methods, private and public variables/methods, const tags, cmake.
